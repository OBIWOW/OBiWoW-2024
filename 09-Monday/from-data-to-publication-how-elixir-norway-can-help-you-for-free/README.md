# From data to publication: how ELIXIR Norway can help you for free
Are you working on a PhD or PostDoc project or applying for funding? Most projects now require a Data Management Plan (DMP), and ELIXIR Norway offers support—often at no cost! Life science research should also follow the FAIR Data principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), but implementing these can be challenging. ELIXIR Norway can assist with this and provide free data storage and analysis pipelines for non-sensitive data. This workshop offers hands-on training for creating DMPs using ELIXIR’s Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW). The workshop also introduces NeLS and usegalaxy.no, two free ELIXIR Norway services for data storage, analysis, and reproducible workflows.
## Instructors
Federico Bianchini, Jon Lærdahl
## Live Troubleshooting Session
There will be no live troubleshooting session for DSW due to the main speaker attending a conference. 
Please contact [Federico Bianchini](https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/people/fredebi/) by email if assistance is required.
For issues on NeLS/Galaxy, it is recommended to contact the ELIXIR helpdesk (support@elixir.no). 

## Software Requirements
The DSW part of the workshop requires an account on [ELIXIR Norway's instance of DSW](https://norway.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/).
The account is created by logging into the service by either Feide or using a dedicated username and password.
Accessing NeLS and Galaxy requires also Feide. Alternatively, a dedicated NeLS identity can be used. You would need to 
apply for this beforehand. Read more details at https://nels.bioinfo.no/.
