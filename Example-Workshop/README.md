## Software installations

### Python

This is our recommended method - it can be used for any purpose and makes a strong base for the future.

Follow the instructions on the miniforge web page. This installs the base, and from here other packages can be installed.

Miniforge uses the command line - this gives you the most power but can feel unfamiliar. See the command line crash course for an intro.

Linux/MacOS: Each time you start a new command line terminal, you can activate Miniforge by running:

```
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate
#This is not needed if you choose yes for "Do you wish
#to update your shell profile to automatically initialize
#conda?" during installation.
```

Windows: Use the “Miniforge Prompt” to start Miniforge. This will set up everything so that conda and mamba are available.
