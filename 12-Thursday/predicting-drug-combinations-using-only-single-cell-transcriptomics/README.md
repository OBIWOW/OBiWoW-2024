# Predicting drug combinations using only single-cell transcriptomics
The challenge of cancer treatment lies in the vast number of potential drug combinations and dosing options. Each cancer type presents unique biological characteristics, and tumors often contain diverse cell populations that respond differently to therapies. This complexity leads to a computational explosion in identifying the most effective treatments. Advanced computational tools are essential for navigating this landscape.   Here, we introduce scTherapy, a new machine learning tool that addresses these challenges by prioritizing multi-targeting therapies for individual cancer patients. It uses single-cell transcriptomic profiles to identify patient-specific treatment options that effectively co-inhibit cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal cells. Experimental validations show that 96% of the predicted multi-targeting treatments demonstrate selective efficacy or synergy, with 83% exhibiting low toxicity.   Participants will learn about scTherapy's approach to analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and utilizing phenotypic response profiles to identify potential therapies that target specific tumor subclones, taking into account the heterogeneity within and across patient samples. Through hands-on application, attendees will understand how to leverage the pre-trained machine learning model within scTherapy to predict compound and dose pairs, ensuring effective and low-toxicity treatment options for individual patients with solid or hematological malignancies.
