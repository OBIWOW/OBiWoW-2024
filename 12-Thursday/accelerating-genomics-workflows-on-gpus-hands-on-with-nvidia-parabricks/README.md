# Accelerating Genomics Workflows on GPUs: Hands-on with NVIDIA Parabricks
In the fast-evolving world of genomics, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipelines are pivotal for the comprehensive evaluation of patient genetic makeup in clinical and research settings. Traditional bioinformatic tools optimized for CPU-based computing often result in prolonged processing times that can extend to several days, creating significant bottlenecks as population genomics studies and clinical practices scale. To address these challenges, accelerated NGS pipelines leveraging graphical processing units (GPUs) have emerged as transformative solutions. This two-hour workshop aims to demonstrate the capabilities of NVIDIA Parabricks tools in NGS analysis. The session will commence with a concise overview of the NVIDIA Parabricks software suite, a leading toolset known for its remarkable ability to drastically reduce computational time while maintaining exceptional precision and recall in variant calling. Attendees will gain insights into the workflow of the Parabricks germline variant calling pipeline. Following the overview, participants will engage in a hands-on session designed to provide practical experience with Parabricks. The workshop will conclude with a brief discussion addressing the advantages and potential limitations of Parabricks. This workshop is ideal for bioinformaticians seeking to enhance their expertise and efficiency in NGS analysis through cutting-edge technological advancements.
