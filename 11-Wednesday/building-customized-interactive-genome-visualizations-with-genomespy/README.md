# Building Customized, Interactive Genome Visualizations with GenomeSpy
Most genome visualization tools are designed for specific data formats and offer limited customization options, often leaving researchers to build entirely new solutions from scratch for tailored visualizations. GenomeSpy (https://genomespy.app/) is a toolkit that addresses this gap by providing a flexible way to create interactive genome visualizations. Built on a visualization grammar, its declarative language allows users to define custom visualizations without extensive programming. Additionally, its unique GPU-accelerated architecture ensures smooth, responsive interactions, even with large datasets.  In this workshop, we will explore the types of visualization challenges that GenomeSpy can address and introduce the fundamentals of its visualization grammar. In the hands-on tutorial, participants will start by exploring a high-grade serous carcinoma dataset using an existing GenomeSpy visualization, demonstrating its capacity to analyze large sample collections effectively. Following this, we will implement simple visualizations using the GenomeSpy Playground application and ObservableHQ notebooks. Additionally, weâ€™ll set up a local website for GenomeSpy, supporting larger-scale visualization projects that can later be deployed on a private or public web server.
