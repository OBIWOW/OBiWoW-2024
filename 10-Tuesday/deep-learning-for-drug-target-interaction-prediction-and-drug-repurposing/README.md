# Deep Learning for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction and Drug Repurposing
This workshop will explore deep learning applications in drug discovery, focusing on two key areas: drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction and drug repurposing. Participants will learn how deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be utilized to predict interactions between drugs and targets, as well as identify potential repurposing opportunities for existing drugs. The workshop will include hands-on coding sessions using publicly available datasets, such as the KIBA dataset, and practical model implementation.
