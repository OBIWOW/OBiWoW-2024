# Streamlining Bioinformatics Data Pipelines with Omnipy
The time is ripe to challenge fundamental assumptions on managing bioinformatics data. With good reason, the notion of piping together command line tools as workflows has long dominated bioinformatics. However, returning to flat files on the command line at each junction adds parsing and serialisation steps that are unnecessary and often change the data in subtle (or less subtle) ways that are hard to fix.  With Omnipy, we instead follow the lead of ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) solutions for Big Data – streamlined as an elegant and powerful Python library. Omnipy offers a systematic and scalable approach to building pipelines where the data is in focus, more than the tools. Through specification of data models/parsers, Omnipy allows researchers to import data in various formats and wrangle the data through stepwise transformations. For automation with large data, Omnipy seamlessly scales up for deployment on remote infrastructures.  The workshop will introduce the Omnipy library and its main concepts. This will take form as a mix of presentations and hands-on exercises. While Omnipy is designed for cross-domain applicability, the primary use cases are bioinformatics-related. We will thus make use of real-world examples that should feel relevant to many of the attendees.  We have held similar workshops before, e.g. for Oslo Bioinformatics Week 2023 (https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/events/oslo-bioinformatics-workshop-week-2023/#02) and Digital Scholarship Days 2024 (https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2024/digital-scholarship-days/22-omnipy-part1.html and https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2024/digital-scholarship-days/22-omnipy-part2.html) at UiO. Continuously improved over several years – not the least through feedback from workshop attendees – Omnipy is finally getting ready for its v1.0 release!
