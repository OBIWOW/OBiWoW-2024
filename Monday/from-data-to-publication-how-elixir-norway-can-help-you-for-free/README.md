# From data to publication: how ELIXIR Norway can help you for free
Are you working on a PhD or PostDoc project or applying for funding? Most projects now require a Data Management Plan (DMP), and ELIXIR Norway offers support—often at no cost! Life science research should also follow the FAIR Data principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability), but implementing these can be challenging. ELIXIR Norway can assist with this and provide free data storage and analysis pipelines for non-sensitive data. This workshop offers hands-on training for creating DMPs using ELIXIR’s Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW). The workshop also introduces NeLS and usegalaxy.no, two free ELIXIR Norway services for data storage, analysis, and reproducible workflows.
